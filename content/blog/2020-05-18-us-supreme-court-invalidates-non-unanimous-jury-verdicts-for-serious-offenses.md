<p>The United States Supreme Court recently held in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-5924_n6io.pdf" target="_blank">Ramos v. Louisiana</a></em> that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, as incorporated against the states, requires a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant of a serious offense. </p>

<!-- excerpt -->

<h2>Facts of the Ramos case</h2>

<p>Defendant, <a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/man-arrested-in-killing-of-woman-found-in-central-city-garbage-can/3375531#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evangelisto Ramos</a> was charged with second degree murder.  The Defendant exercised his right to a jury trial.  The jury deliberated and ten of the twelve jurors voted to convict the Defendant, finding that the prosecution had proven its case against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. Two jurors reached the opposite conclusion.</p>

<p>Under Louisianaâ€™s non-unanimous jury verdict law, only 10 out of 12 jurors must find the defendant guilty for a conviction.  As a result, Ramos was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

<h3>Statement of the case</h3>

<p>Ramos appealed the district court's conviction. The state appellate court affirmed the lower (district) court's ruling. The Louisiana Supreme Court denied review so the defendant applied for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari, and found in favor of the defendant.  </p>
