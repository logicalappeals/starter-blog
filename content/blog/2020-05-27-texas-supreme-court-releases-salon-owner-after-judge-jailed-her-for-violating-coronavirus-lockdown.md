<p>On Thursday, May 7, 2020, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the release of salon owner, Shelley Luther, who was jailed for re-opening her salon in violation of the state's stay at home order.</p>

<p>Recently, Texas governor, Greg Abbott, issued an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/abbott-no-jail-time-for-texas-business-owners-who-violated-coronavirus-related-orders/ar-BB13Kle8" target="_blank">executive order</a> retroactively terminating jail time as a punishment for violating the state's Wuhan-Coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>Following governor Abbott's announcement, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/orders-opinions/2020/may/may-7-2020/" target="_blank">the Supreme Court of Texas ordered </a>the salon owner's release.  Luther applied to the Texas Supreme Court for a Writ of Habeas Corpus in Case No. 20-0363; IN RE SHELLY LUTHER.  Luther argued that she was being illegally restrained by virtue of a contempt order issued by the 14th District Court of Dallas County, Texas.</p>


<p>Judge Eric Moye originally sentenced the hair salon owner to seven days in jail and a $7,000 fine for re-opening her salon in defiance of the state's lockdown orders.</p>


<p>Judge Moye told Ms. Luther that although her decision was “selfish,” she could <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/texas-judge-sentences-salon-owner-to-jail-time-after-she-refuses-to-apologize-for-selfish-decision-to-open/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid jail time if she apologized</a> for her wrongthink and admitted wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Judge Moye said that Luther’s statement should make clear “that you now see the error of your ways, and understand that the society cannot function where ones own belief in a concept of ‘liberty’ permits you to flaunt your disdain for the rulings of duly elected officials.” The statement would also include acknowledgement that the “proper way” to challenge a ruling would be to hire a lawyer to make that case.</p>

<p>Luther responded: “Judge, I would like to say that I have much respect for this court and laws . . . I have to disagree with you, sir, when you say that I’m ‘selfish,’ because feeding my kids is not selfish. I have hair stylists that are going hungry because they’d rather feed their kids. So, sir, if you think the law is more important than kids getting fed, then please go ahead with your decision, but I am not going to shut the salon.”</p>
