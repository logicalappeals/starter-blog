The United States Supreme Court recently granted cert. in *[Edwards v. Vannoy](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/19-5807.html)*, Warden, ––– U.S. ––––, ––– S.Ct. ––––, ––– L.Ed.2d ––––, 2020 WL 2105209 (Mem).  *Edwards* is set to decide the issue regarding whether *[Ramos](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-5924_n6io.pdf)* applies retroactively to Federal cases on collateral review.

Nevertheless, does *Ramos* apply retroactively to state cases on collateral review? For these reasons, we believe it does not:

The Louisiana Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court employ the retroactivity framework of *[Teague v. Lane](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/288/)*, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).  See*[ State v. Gipson](https://www.lasc.org/Opinions/2020/19-1815.KH.bjj.grant.pdf)*, 2019-01815, (La. 6/3/20) --- So.3d ----2020 WL 3427193 (Mem) (Johnson, C.J., dissenting) (citing *State ex rel. Taylor v. Whitley*, 606 So. 2d 1292, 1296 (La. 1992)).  

Under *Teague*, as a general rule, new rules of criminal procedure do not apply retroactively on collateral review. 

The Louisiana Supreme Court recently denied writ applications in similarly situated non-unanimous jury verdict "*Ramos"* cases based, in part, on the fact that Louisiana employs the retroactivity framework of Teague.  *See State v. Farrier*, 2019-02002, (La. 6/3/20) --- So.3d ----, 2020 WL 3424525 (Mem), 2019-02002 (La. 6/3/20); *State v. Gipson*, 2019-01815, (La. 6/3/20).

In *State v. Farrier* and *State v. Gipson* the Louisiana Supreme Court stated:

"In 1992, we adopted Teague’s test for determining whether decisions affecting rights of criminal procedure would be retroactively applied in cases on state collateral review. State ex rel. Taylor v. Whitley, 606 So. 2d 1292, 1296 (La. 1992). Teague only requires retroactive application of a new rule if it is a “watershed rul\[e] of criminal procedure” that “implicates the fundamental fairness \[and accuracy]” of the criminal proceeding. Teague, 489 U.S. at 311–312."

*State v. Farrier*, 2019-02002, (La. 6/3/20) (Johnson, C.J., dissenting); *State v. Gipson*, 2019-01815, (La. 6/3/20) (Johnson, C.J., dissenting).  

Because the Louisiana Supreme Court’s majority denied the defendants’ writ applications in *Farrier* and *Gipson*, it follows that majority’s view is that *Ramos* did not announce a “watershed” rule.  Thus, it is unlikely that the Louisiana Supreme Court would break away from the aforementioned application of the retroactivity framework of *Teague* in *Ramos* cases on collateral review. 

Further, the United States Supreme Court has yet to hold that a new procedural rule is a “watershed rule” applied retroactively:
"The Supreme Court has so narrowed such “watershed” rules, however, that the doctrine is highly exceptional. Over the past quarter-century since Teague, the Court has refused to confer watershed status on even one new rule of constitutional criminal procedure among the dozens it has announced. The only rule that would have qualified, the Court has said, is the right to assistance of counsel. This rule was first announced in Gideon v. Wainwright, long before Teague, and the Court has characterized this rule's unique centrality to “basic due process” as “unlikely . . . to emerge” again. Accordingly, not a single prisoner since Teague has, by judgment of the Supreme Court, benefited from a constitutional reform that took hold after direct review of his case, no matter how profound that reform had been and whether it would have enhanced the conviction's accuracy if it were to apply at trial or on appeal. Those reforms offer no grounds for relief after a conviction becomes final under the verboten due process regime that has, if even one day later, been authoritatively declared constitutionally deficient."  Dov Fox & Alex Stein, Constitutional Retroactivity in Criminal Procedure, 91 Wash. L. Rev. 463, 467 (2016).

Thus, for these reasons, it is unlikely that *Ramos* would apply to State cases in Louisiana on collateral review at this time.
